# Robot Structure

The robot consists of three engineering parts: **the movement system**, **the steering system**, and **the frame**.

## Movement System
The movement system is made of a gear mechanism that **increases torque** and **reduces speed**.  
This is necessary because the motor operates at a very high speed.  
All gear connections are lubricated with oil to reduce friction and wear, and **bearings are used to ensure smoother rotation and durability**.  
The movement system parts are **3D-printed**.

## Steering System
The steering system is based on a **gear and rack** principle.  
It is designed so that the rack moves only to the right or left, without shifting sideways.  
This prevents:
- stress on the servo mechanism,  
- gear teeth slipping,  
- inaccurate turns.  

The steering system parts are also **3D-printed**.

## Frame
The frame is made of **plywood** and is **laser-cut**.  
It consists of several levels with a compact removal system.  
This allows the robot to be disassembled more easily — for example, if the movement system breaks, several plates can be removed at once without dismantling the entire robot.  

The multi-level structure:
- makes the design clearer,  
- reduces the robot’s width and length,  
- provides a more organized and aesthetic appearance.
