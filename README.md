WRO Future Engineers documentation 
Team Name: KU STEAM Pinkies
Project Title:   
## Team Introduction
We are **KU STEAM Pinkies**, a passionate group of young engineers with a shared vision:  
To build a reliable and fully autonomous robot capable of navigating real-world environments.

**Team Members & Roles:**
- **Marius** – Programmer
- **Domas** – Electronics Specialist
- **Jonas** – Mechanical Designer
  
By combining our individual strengths, responsibilities, and teamwork, we were able to design, build, and refine a reliable autonomous car ready for competition. 

**Our Goal:** 
 To create an autonomous, environment-aware robot that can move and make decisions independently, efficiently avoiding obstacles in real time.
 
## Ideas and Principles
This was one of the most complex projects we’ve worked on. We followed several guiding rules and ideas that helped us make decisions quickly and efficiently. 
**Core Principles:** 
- Reliability over speed – better to be a bit slower, but always working 
- Simplicity is key – avoid overly complex solutions 
- Iterative improvement – enhance step by step 
-	Testing over theory – everything is tested in practice 
-	Mistakes = data – failure means learning something new
   
**Effective Ideas:** 
-	Switched from ultrasonic to TOF for more stable side detection 
-	Used PID control for smooth turning 
-	3D printed mounts for fast design changes 
-	Kept code structured: sensor reading, decision-making, and action execution separated 
-	Built the frame from plywood for strength without excess weight 
-	Tested under real conditions – recreated the map at home for accuracy 

## Robot Movement Control

The robot moves using a **single-motor drive** powering the rear wheels. The **direction is controlled** using a **gear and rack mechanism** that adjusts the angle of the front axle wheels. A **servo motor**, controlled via a **PWM signal**, allows precise steering adjustments.

## TOF Sensor Placement

To ensure stable movement **parallel to a wall**, two **TOF (Time-of-Flight) sensors** are mounted on the same side:

- `x₁` – **Front** (beam **AA₁**)
- `x₂` – **Rear** (beam **BB₁**)

> **Important:** Beams **AA₁** and **BB₁** are parallel because both TOF sensors are mounted parallel to each other, **perpendicular to the robot's chassis**.

This setup allows precise estimation of:

- Whether the robot is angled relative to the wall (`Δx`)

## Key Measurements

The control is based on two differences:

- `Δx = x₂ − x₁` → **Angular tilt**
- `Δd = d₁ − d₂` → **Distance difference from the wall**

- `Δx` is used to **correct the angle** – if the front distance is smaller than the rear (or vice versa), the robot isn't parallel to the wall.
- The system adjusts the **front axle angle** until `Δx ≈ 0`.

## Steering Adjustment: PID Control

To avoid **sudden and uncontrolled turns**, the turning angle of the front axle is adjusted gradually using a **simple PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative)** control algorithm.

### PID Logic Ensures:

- Reactions to errors (`Δx` or `Δd`) are **proportional** to their size
- **No sudden jumps** – angle changes gradually depending on the **rate of change**
- **Long-term deviations** are corrected smoothly, even if sensor data briefly fluctuates

## Resulting Benefits

This control system allows the robot to:

- ✅ Maintain a **smooth, straight trajectory**
- ✅ **Avoid colliding** with walls
- ✅ Move **safely** even in narrow paths
