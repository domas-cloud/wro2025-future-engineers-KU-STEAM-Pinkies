WRO Future Engineers documentation 
Team Name: KU STEAM TP-40 
Project Title:   
## Team Introduction
We are **KU STEAM Pinkies**, a passionate group of young engineers with a shared vision:  
To build a reliable and fully autonomous robot capable of navigating real-world environments.

**Team Members & Roles:**
- **Marius** â€“ Programmer
- **Domas** â€“ Electronics Specialist
- **Jonas** â€“ Mechanical Designer
  
By combining our individual strengths, responsibilities, and teamwork, we were able to design, build, and refine a reliable autonomous car ready for competition. 

**Our Goal:** 
 To create an autonomous, environment-aware robot that can move and make decisions independently, efficiently avoiding obstacles in real time.
 
## Ideas and Principles
This was one of the most complex projects weâ€™ve worked on. We followed several guiding rules and ideas that helped us make decisions quickly and efficiently. 
**Core Principles:** 
- Reliability over speed â€“ better to be a bit slower, but always working 
- Simplicity is key â€“ avoid overly complex solutions 
- Iterative improvement â€“ enhance step by step 
-	Testing over theory â€“ everything is tested in practice 
-	Mistakes = data â€“ failure means learning something new
   
**Effective Ideas:** 
-	Switched from ultrasonic to TOF for more stable side detection 
-	Used PID control for smooth turning 
-	3D printed mounts for fast design changes 
-	Kept code structured: sensor reading, decision-making, and action execution separated 
-	Built the frame from plywood for strength without excess weight 
-	Tested under real conditions â€“ recreated the map at home for accuracy
