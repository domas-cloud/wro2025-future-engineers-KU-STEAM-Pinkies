# 🤖   - WRO 2025 Future Engineers: KU STEAM Pinkies

## Project Overview
Our project focuses on developing an **autonomous robot car** designed to compete in the WRO 2025 Future Engineers category.  
The robot integrates:
- **Arduino Mega 2560** for real-time sensor and actuator control  
- **Raspberry Pi Zero 2** for camera processing and communication  
- **TOF (VL53L1X) sensors** for obstacle detection and trajectory maintenance  
- **Color sensor (TCS34725)** to detect and count **orange and blue track lines**  
- **Servo-based steering** and **DC motor drivetrain with bearings** for smooth movement  

This combination allows the robot to **detect obstacles, count checkpoints, and maintain its path** accurately under different conditions.

Project   
## Team Introduction
We are **KU STEAM Pinkies**, a passionate group of young engineers with a shared vision:  
To build a reliable and fully autonomous robot capable of navigating real-world environments.

**Team Members & Roles:**
- **Marius** – Programmer and Mechanical Designer
- **Domas** – Manager, Marketing and Testing
- **Jonas** – Electronics Specialist and Design
  
By combining our individual strengths, responsibilities, and teamwork, we were able to design, build, and refine a reliable autonomous car ready for competition. 

**Our Goal:** 
 To create an autonomous, environment-aware robot that can move and make decisions independently, efficiently avoiding obstacles in real time.
