WRO Future Engineers documentation 
Team Name: KU STEAM Pinkies
Project Title:   
## Team Introduction
We are **KU STEAM Pinkies**, a passionate group of young engineers with a shared vision:  
To build a reliable and fully autonomous robot capable of navigating real-world environments.

**Team Members & Roles:**
- **Marius** ‚Äì Programmer and Mechanical Designer
- **Domas** ‚Äì Manager, Marketing and Testing
- **Jonas** ‚Äì Electronics Specialist and Design
  
By combining our individual strengths, responsibilities, and teamwork, we were able to design, build, and refine a reliable autonomous car ready for competition. 

**Our Goal:** 
 To create an autonomous, environment-aware robot that can move and make decisions independently, efficiently avoiding obstacles in real time.
 
## Ideas and Principles
This was one of the most complex projects we‚Äôve worked on. We followed several guiding rules and ideas that helped us make decisions quickly and efficiently. 
**Core Principles:** 
- Reliability over speed ‚Äì better to be a bit slower, but always working 
- Simplicity is key ‚Äì avoid overly complex solutions 
- Iterative improvement ‚Äì enhance step by step 
-	Testing over theory ‚Äì everything is tested in practice 
-	Mistakes = data ‚Äì failure means learning something new
   
**Effective Ideas:** 
-	Switched from ultrasonic to TOF for more stable side detection 
-	Used PID control for smooth turning 
-	3D printed mounts for fast design changes 
-	Kept code structured: sensor reading, decision-making, and action execution separated 
-	Built the frame from plywood for strength without excess weight 
-	Tested under real conditions ‚Äì recreated the map at home for accuracy 

## Robot Movement Control

The robot moves using a **single-motor drive** powering the rear wheels. The **direction is controlled** using a **gear and rack mechanism** that adjusts the angle of the front axle wheels. A **servo motor**, controlled via a **PWM signal**, allows precise steering adjustments.

## TOF Sensor Placement

To ensure stable movement **parallel to a wall**, two **TOF (Time-of-Flight) sensors** are mounted on the same side:

- `x‚ÇÅ` ‚Äì **Front** (beam **AA‚ÇÅ**)
- `x‚ÇÇ` ‚Äì **Rear** (beam **BB‚ÇÅ**)

> **Important:** Beams **AA‚ÇÅ** and **BB‚ÇÅ** are parallel because both TOF sensors are mounted parallel to each other, **perpendicular to the robot's chassis**.

This setup allows precise estimation of:

- Whether the robot is angled relative to the wall (`Œîx`)

## Key Measurements

The control is based on two differences:

- `Œîx = x‚ÇÇ ‚àí x‚ÇÅ` ‚Üí **Angular tilt**

- `Œîx` is used to **correct the angle** ‚Äì if the front distance is smaller than the rear (or vice versa), the robot isn't parallel to the wall.
- The system adjusts the **front axle angle** until `Œîx ‚âà 0`.

## Steering Adjustment: PID Control

To avoid **sudden and uncontrolled turns**, the turning angle of the front axle is adjusted gradually using a **simple PID (Proportional‚ÄìIntegral‚ÄìDerivative)** control algorithm.

### PID Logic Ensures:

- Reactions to errors (`Œîx`) are **proportional** to their size
- **No sudden jumps** ‚Äì angle changes gradually depending on the **rate of change**
- **Long-term deviations** are corrected smoothly, even if sensor data briefly fluctuates
