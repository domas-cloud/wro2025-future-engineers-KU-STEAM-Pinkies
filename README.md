Team Name: KU STEAM TP-40 
Project Title:   
## Team Introduction
We are **KU STEAM Pinkies**, a passionate group of young engineers with a shared vision:  
To build a reliable and fully autonomous robot capable of navigating real-world environments.

**Team Members & Roles:**
- **Marius** â€“ Programmer
- **Domas** â€“ Electronics Specialist
- **Jonas** â€“ Mechanical Designer
  
By combining our individual strengths, responsibilities, and teamwork, we were able to design, build, and refine a reliable autonomous car ready for competition. 
Our Goal: 
 To create an autonomous, environment-aware robot that can move and make decisions independently, efficiently avoiding obstacles in real time.
