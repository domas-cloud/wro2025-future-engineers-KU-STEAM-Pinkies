WRO Future Engineers documentation 
Team Name: KU STEAM TP-40 
Project Title:   
## Team Introduction
We are **KU STEAM Pinkies**, a passionate group of young engineers with a shared vision:  
To build a reliable and fully autonomous robot capable of navigating real-world environments.

**Team Members & Roles:**
- **Marius** – Programmer
- **Domas** – Electronics Specialist
- **Jonas** – Mechanical Designer
  
By combining our individual strengths, responsibilities, and teamwork, we were able to design, build, and refine a reliable autonomous car ready for competition. 

**Our Goal:** 
 To create an autonomous, environment-aware robot that can move and make decisions independently, efficiently avoiding obstacles in real time.
 
## Ideas and Principles
This was one of the most complex projects we’ve worked on. We followed several guiding rules and ideas that helped us make decisions quickly and efficiently. 
Core Principles: 
•	Reliability over speed – better to be a bit slower, but always working 
•	Simplicity is key – avoid overly complex solutions 
•	Iterative improvement – enhance step by step 
•	Testing over theory – everything is tested in practice 
•	Mistakes = data – failure means learning something new 
Effective Ideas: 
•	Switched from ultrasonic to TOF for more stable side detection 
•	Used PID control for smooth turning 
•	3D printed mounts for fast design changes 
•	Kept code structured: sensor reading, decision-making, and action execution separated 
•	Built the frame from plywood for strength without excess weight 
•	Tested under real conditions – recreated the map at home for accuracy
